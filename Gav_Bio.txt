I was the first in my family to be born in Australia, the rest all being from Hong Kong. Before coming to RMIT, I studied at Swinburne University of Technology for three years. I used to play sports, mainly ball and racket based ones such as tennis and squash. Other than sports, reading and gaming, I also like to dance and work out. I prefer a Korean pop style of dance. My interest in IT stemmed from a curiosity on how tech and other electronics worked. Taking them apart only resulted in them breaking. I enjoy diagnosing broken code and electronics, and figuring out how to get it working. I hope to get into a field of game testing where I could test unreleased games, and fix bugs.
